# Advent of Code Task Solution in REXX

This document describes a REXX script designed to solve an Advent of Code task. The task remains unspecified but seems to involve processing game-related input data and calculating certain outcomes.

## Script Overview

The script processes an input file, counts the number of specific items (red, green, blue) in various sets, and calculates the sum of the products of the largest counts for each color per game.

## Input and Attributes

The input file is read and each line is processed one by one:

```rexx
x = bpxwunix('cat /z/z35259/AoC23Input/input2.txt',,file.,se.)
```

The script starts with predefined counts for red, green, and blue items:

```rexx
red = 12
green = 13
blue = 14
```

## Main Loop Processing

For each line in the input data, which corresponds to a game, the script:

1. Replaces underscores with spaces.
2. Prints the line to the console.
3. Extracts game information.

```rexx
do line over input
  ...
end
```

Within the loop, the maximum counts of each color are found per game. The input data format is assumed to be structured in a way that represents sets of items within a game.

## Solution Calculation

The script calculates the product of the largest counts of red, green, and blue items per game and sums them across all games:

```rexx
pow3 = lg * lr * lb
sumpow = sumpow + pow3
```

## Output

The script outputs two pieces of information:

1. The sum of IDs for possible games (although the variable `possibilities` is not updated within the code and thus the output is unclear):

   ```rexx
   say 'Sum of IDs for possible games:' possibilities
   ```
   
2. A sum of products (powers) of the maximum amounts of colors per game:

   ```rexx
   say sumpow
   ```

## How to Run

- Ensure the input file `/z/z35259/AoC23Input/input2.txt` contains the data structured as required by the script.
- Execute the script using a REXX interpreter.
- Check the printed output for the summed outcomes.
